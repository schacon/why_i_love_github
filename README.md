# Why I Love GitHub

* It is pretty
* It is easy to edit files
* It is pretty easy to edit files
* It is pretty easy to user script it to become [better than the githubbers already made it](https://github.com/johan/github-improved/raw/master/unfold_commit_history.user.js); even before they implement something like it, I can tweak the commit history view to be able to:
  * click a commit to unfold its diff in place
  * fold and unfold a diff I opened, and the individual files it was editing
  * click "committer" to reflow the view with them on the right side instead of below
  * click the commit timestamp to see weekday and full ISO times
  * click an author icon to filter the view by author, and see which committers have been most active
